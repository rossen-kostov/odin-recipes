    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I
      didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites. Also, I used water
      instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these
      with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup cold water or milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest(just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta
        cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until
        smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon
        juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together,
        stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
        Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches).
        When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes
        start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until
        cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.
