    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I've been messing around trying to make a perfect strawberry cupcake to go
      with the Real Strawberry Frosting I developed a couple of years ago. It's
      been a long road and lots of cupcakes tested and tasted along the way. The
      trick was NOT using puree as I do when making the frosting. Rather,
      grinding freeze-dried strawberries into a powder brought this cupcake
      recipe out of my test kitchen and into my recipe box! I am so pleased with
      the results!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/4 ounces freeze-dried strawberries</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cup cake flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoon bakinkg powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 1/3 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2/3 cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin tins with
          20 cupcake liners (for mini cupcakes, line 72 mini muffin tins).
        </p>
      </li>

          Grind strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or food
          processor. Whisk strawberry powder, all-purpose flour, cake flour,
          baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beat butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and
          fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add
          room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into
          butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir flour mixture, alternately with the milk, into butter mixture
          until just incorporated. Fill lined tins with cupcake batter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in preheated oven until cupcakes spring back when gently touched
          with a fingertip or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
          clean, 16 to 18 minutes for regular cupcakes, 8 to 10 minutes for mini
          cupcakes.
